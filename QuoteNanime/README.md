## **About The Project**


QuoteNanime is a web application designed to help you pick your next anime binge. Enter the title of an anime, and the app will generate a random quote from that anime.

Here's why this project exists:

- **Discover New Anime:** Get a random quote to decide your next watch.
- **Get Detailed Information:** Learn about the anime, its characters, and the director.
- **Future Plans:** Includes features like an anime quiz and a search engine for finding anime, characters, and directors.
